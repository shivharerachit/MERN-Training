# Day-5: Learning Basics of JavaScript

On Day-5 of the event, we covered the basics of JavaScript, including variable definitions, conditions, loops, data types, and operations on them. Below is a summary of the topics we learned:

## Topics Covered

### 1. Variable Definition
- We learned how to define variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Examples of defining strings using different quotes (`"`, `'`, and `` ` ``).
- Using template literals to embed variables within strings.

### 2. Conditions
- We explored conditional statements using `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
- Example: Checking voting eligibility based on age ([vote-check.html](vote-check.html)).
- Example: Determining grades based on marks ([student-grade.html](student-grade.html)).

### 3. Loops
- We learned about different types of loops including `while`, `do...while`, and `for`.
- Example: Using `do...while` loop to print messages ([while.html](while.html)).

### 4. Switch Case
- We covered the `switch` statement to handle multiple conditions.
- Example: Printing messages based on user input ([switch-case.html](switch-case.html)).

### 5. Data Types and Operations
- We discussed various data types such as strings, numbers, objects, and arrays.
- Examples of string operations like `length`, `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, `concat`, and `slice`.
- Example of defining and accessing object properties.
- Example of array operations like `slice`.

## Summary
Day-5 provided a solid foundation in JavaScript basics, which are essential for any web development project. We practiced defining variables, using conditional statements, implementing loops, and performing operations on different data types.
