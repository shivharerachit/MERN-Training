# MERN Training - Day 7

## Topics Covered

1. **Node.js HTTP Module**
   - Creating a basic HTTP server using the `http` module.
   - Handling HTTP requests and responses.
   - Setting headers and status codes in responses.

2. **Project Structure**
   - Organizing files and directories in a Node.js project.
   - Understanding the purpose of `package.json` files in different directories.

3. **NPM Scripts**
   - Using `scripts` in `package.json` to run commands.
   - Setting up `start` and `dev` scripts for running and developing the server.

4. **Modules and Exports**
   - Importing and exporting modules using `require` and `module.exports`.
   - Structuring and organizing code in separate files for better maintainability.

5. **Dependencies and DevDependencies**
   - Managing project dependencies using `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in `package.json`.

## Practical Implementation

- Created a basic HTTP server in `server/server.js` and `server/index.js`.
- Organized fruit-related data in separate files under the `fruits` directory.
- Set up `package.json` files to manage dependencies and scripts for both the main project and the server.
