# Day 6: MERN Training - Basics of JavaScript

## Overview
On the 6th day of my MERN training, I focused on learning the basics of JavaScript. This included understanding variables, loops, arrays, and basic operations. Below is a summary of the key concepts I worked on.

---

## Key Concepts

### Variables
- Learned how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understood the naming conventions for variables, including valid characters and formatting.

---

### Loops
- Explored the use of `for` loops to iterate over arrays and objects.
- Practiced looping techniques for traversing and manipulating data structures.

---

### Arrays
- Created arrays using `new Array()` and array literals.
- Performed operations on arrays, such as adding, concatenating, reversing, slicing, and splicing elements.

---

### Patterns and Fibonacci Sequence
- Learned to generate different patterns using nested loops.
- Understood the logic for calculating the Fibonacci sequence iteratively.

---

### Todo List Application
- Built a simple Todo List application using JavaScript.
- Added functionality to:
  - Add tasks to the list.
  - Read and display tasks.
  - Delete specific tasks based on user input.

## Conclusion
This day was focused on getting comfortable with the basics of JavaScript, which is essential for building more complex applications in the MERN stack. Understanding these foundational concepts is a crucial step toward mastering JavaScript.
